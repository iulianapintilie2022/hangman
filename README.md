❤️❤️ Small mini game in the console taking input - Hangman from Hyperskill ❤️❤️

Hangman is a popular yet grim puzzle game. A cruel computer hides a word from you, which you try to guess letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be “hanged”.
If you win, you'll survive. You’ve probably played the game at least once or twice. 
The computer makes sure you input only lowercase English letters(only one at a time) and displays messages if they fit inside the random generated word. You can play and see how many times you win or you lose. 🥇🏆
